# MyReads

A responsive web app which keeps track of the books you are **currently viewing**, **want to read** and those you have already **read**. It also provides **search** functionlity, allows you to look for books by name or author so that you can eventually add them to one of your three shelves. You can also **transfer** books among the three bookshelves by the shelf changer attached to each book.
